            <h1 id="about">Hi, I am Alejandro Machado.</h1>
            <p>I am a <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/" target="_blank">software designer and engineer.</a></p>
            <p>I hold a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University,
            and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Universidad Simón Bolívar.</p>

            <p>See how I'm spending my time <a href="/now/">now.</a></p>
            <p>Here are some of my projects.</p>

            <h2>Zazzle</h2>
            <p>I worked at <a href="http://www.zazzle.com" target="_blank">zazzle.com</a> as a location-independent UI designer during early 2015. 
            Collaborating closely with the rest of the Design Team in California, 
            I followed a quick research–explore–prototype methodology to develop
            Zazzle's style guide and improve consistency across their digital channels: 
            website, mobile apps and emails.</p>

            <img alt="Three examples of UI redesign proposals that I delivered." src="img/zazzle-2015.jpg" />

            <p>During the summer of 2014, I interned as an Experience Designer with Zazzle's Product Team.
            We studied user archetypes by developing personas from customer visits and designed
            a push notifications service for Zazzle's mobile app. My friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-appleby/69/462/214/en" target="_blank">Matt Appleby</a> and I envisioned and prototyped a new app using Sketch, Quartz Composer and the iOS SDK.</p>

            <img alt="Some insights gathered from a customer during his visit, details of a user's interaction with the notifications center, and a prototype of the novel app concept running on the iOS simulator." src="img/zazzle-2014.jpg" />

            <h2>MHCI Capstone Project: Spark</h2>
            <p>As part of a team of four, in 2014 I worked with a multimedia agency based in Funchal to design and develop
            an application to foster well-being by encouraging people to participate in unexpected daily challenges.</p>
            
            <p>We conducted exhaustive research
            and tested prototypes of varied fidelities, throughout several iterations, as a means to refining our concept and delivering
            a product that is both useful and usable. A more detailed account can be found on <a href="http://spark.m-iti.org/" target="_blank">the project's official website.</a></p>

            <p>Besides leading the user research efforts with my teammates, I built working prototypes of the application
            using the iOS SDK. Our team performed usability tests with these models so that we could quickly decide
            what changes to make, based on the users' feedback.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>In the context of solving human problems using computers, the most daunting challenge
            lies not on the technical process of building a piece of software, but in 
            crafting an experience that puts people in the center, where the system
            communicates clearly and empowers the user to achieve her goals.
            This is where thoughtful design and solid engineering meet.</p>

            <p>First, I strive to obtain a deep understanding of people's needs with user research techniques.
            With these insights, I identify a problem by making informed assumptions 
            that will have to be re-examined in future iterations. Next, I explore the solution space 
            by thinking creatively, often with groups of people.</p>

            <p>Then comes the part I most enjoy working in: prototyping. It is about marrying what has
            been envisioned by design to what can be built (quickly) by engineering, and putting it in
            front of the people for a humbling lesson that makes you learn and reiterate.</p>
